# ðŸ¦„ Connect

Our mission at Upframe involves bringing students and mentors together in a whole new way. We want to revolutionize the way an entrepreneurial individual can contact more experienced peers and unlock the full potential of mentorship. For this reason we decided to develop **Connect**.

# Installation

Quick and easy install thanks to Yarn

```
git clone https://github.com/upframe/connect.git
cd connect
yarn install
```

# Running

```
yarn start
```

# Code Structure

Inside the source folder there are two folders. The first folder, components, has individual components
that are used by the elements in the second folder, pages, which consist of groups of components. This
allows us to recycle components throughout the app but maintain the code organization with pages.
